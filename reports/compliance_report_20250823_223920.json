Verbal agreements are not considered valid for enforceability.\n\nConfidentiality Rule:\nClient data must not be shared with third parties unless explicit consent has been obtained and legal safeguards such as GDPR or HIPAA compliance are in place.\n\nPayment Terms Rule:\nContracts should include fair payment terms. Clauses stating \"no refunds under any circumstance\" are not compliant with consumer protection laws.\n\nTermination Rule:\nTermination clauses must provide reasonable notice to both parties. A clause allowing termination without notice is considered unfair and non-compliant.\n\nGoverning Law Rule:\nContracts must specify a valid legal jurisdiction on Earth. Any non-recognized jurisdiction (e.g., fictional or extraterrestrial) is invalid and unenforceable.",
