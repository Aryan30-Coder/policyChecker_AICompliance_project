Contract Scope Rule:
All contracts must clearly define the scope of services in writing. Verbal agreements are not considered valid for enforceability.

Confidentiality Rule:
Client data must not be shared with third parties unless explicit consent has been obtained and legal safeguards such as GDPR or HIPAA compliance are in place.

Payment Terms Rule:
Contracts should include fair payment terms. Clauses stating "no refunds under any circumstance" are not compliant with consumer protection laws.

Termination Rule:
Termination clauses must provide reasonable notice to both parties. A clause allowing termination without notice is considered unfair and non-compliant.

Governing Law Rule:
Contracts must specify a valid legal jurisdiction on Earth. Any non-recognized jurisdiction (e.g., fictional or extraterrestrial) is invalid and unenforceable.
